        <p>During sophomore year of high school, Sepanta's chemistry teacher mentioned in class one day that it was impossible to swallow a teaspoon of cinnamon. Upon hearing this, Sepanta went home and defiantly stuffed a spoonful of cinnamon into his mouth, spending the next 10 minutes choking into the kitchen sink. Later that year, he ate 6 Atomic Fireballs simultaneously on a dare, and lived to tell the tale to his doctor the following day while explaining the white burn marks in his mouth. His doctor was not as impressed as Sepanta thought he should have been.</p><p>While Sepanta has maintained his enthusiasm and appetite for a good challenge, he has since shifted his focus towards other (some might say "more real") topics. As a creative and dynamic project manager, he aspires to use his skills, passion, and stubbornness towards bettering a world riddled with social and environmental problems. He looks forward to a world full of empathy, love, and understanding, and is working to get there, one spoon at a time.</p><p>In addition, Sepanta is a big fan of songwriting, visual expression, and the Oxford comma.</p>
